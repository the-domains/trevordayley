    description: "Last month, I took the Nikon D810 out on the Sierra High Route - one of the toughest adventures around. It got dirty, wet, and constantly banged around. Here's how it performed. Three years ago, my roommate bought a D800E. I've always shot Canon, but he let me borrow his Nikon for a couple of shoots."

    description: 'The headlines all start to sound the same after awhile. Seven people shot inside Louisville nightclub. Four men shot in Suffolk early Sunday morning. Two dead, two hospitalized in Brice Street shooting. The shootings happen so often, the circumstances become so familiar, that we tune them out.'

description: As a wedding photographer I am always on the hunt for that perfect second shooter. Over the last 4 years I have shot 120+ weddings and worked with over 70 different second shooters. Most of them have been fantastic but I have always thought it would be nice to have a list of second shooter tips I could send them before the wedding day.
