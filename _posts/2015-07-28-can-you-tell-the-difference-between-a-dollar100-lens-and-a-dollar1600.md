    description: "Last month, I took the Nikon D810 out on the Sierra High Route - one of the toughest adventures around. It got dirty, wet, and constantly banged around. Here's how it performed. Three years ago, my roommate bought a D800E. I've always shot Canon, but he let me borrow his Nikon for a couple of shoots."

Using a filter, after the snap, to make a regular photo look vintage, is as easy as a mouse click. So is removing a light post that seems to be shooting out of someone's head by using photoshop."

Two dead, two hospitalized in Brice Street shooting. The shootings happen so often, the circumstances become so familiar, that we tune them out.'
