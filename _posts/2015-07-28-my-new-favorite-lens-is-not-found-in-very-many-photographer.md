    description: "Last month, I took the Nikon D810 out on the Sierra High Route - one of the toughest adventures around. It got dirty, wet, and constantly banged around. Here's how it performed.

description: About two months ago I was thinking about my upcoming wedding season that starts this weekend and lasts till June. Shooting a wedding every weekend can really challenge your creativity.
